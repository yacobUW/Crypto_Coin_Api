# Project Improvements and Future Plans

Here are some ideas and improvements that I plan to implement for the Crypto Information Portal project:

## 1. Enhanced User Interface

- Implement a more interactive and user-friendly command-line interface with clearer prompts and options.

## 2. More Data Display

- Include additional data such as 24-hour trading volume, market capitalization, and percentage changes in price.
- Display historical data trends to visualize changes over a longer time frame.

## 3. Favorite Cryptocurrencies

- Allow users to save their favorite cryptocurrencies for quick access in future sessions.
- Implement a feature to view details for multiple cryptocurrencies at once.

## 4. Error Handling and Resilience

- Enhance error handling to provide more informative messages for different types of errors.
- Implement retry mechanisms for failed API requests due to network issues.

## 5. Portfolio Tracker

- Add a simple portfolio tracking feature where users can input the quantity of their holdings and see the total value.
- Store portfolio data locally and allow users to export/import their portfolio.

## 6. Price Alerts

- Implement a feature that allows users to set price alerts for specific cryptocurrencies and receive notifications when prices hit a certain threshold.

## 7. User Preferences

- Allow users to set their default currency for price display.
- Provide options to customize the appearance of charts and data presentation.
